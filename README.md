Web Application Security Testing – Task 1
This repository contains the security assessment of the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application), conducted as part of Task 1 of my internship. The objective of this task was to identify and understand common web application vulnerabilities using real-world techniques and automated tools.

📁 Repository Structure
🔒 SQLInjection/
This folder contains:

Screenshots of successful SQL injection attacks.

Video demonstrations of data extraction using SQL injection techniques.

🖥️ XSS/
This folder contains:

Examples of Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

A demonstration of reflected XSS used to retrieve the session ID and other sensitive data.

🔐 AuthFlaws/
This folder contains:

A report on authentication flaws identified during scanning with OWASP ZAP.

A detailed analysis of vulnerabilities found in the authentication and session management processes.

📑 FinalReport/
This folder contains:

Task1_WebAppTesting_Report.docm: The final detailed report, which includes all findings, tools used, and mitigation strategies.

🧰 Tools Used
Burp Suite: A widely used web vulnerability scanner and proxy tool.

SQLMap: A powerful tool for detecting and exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities.

OWASP ZAP: An open-source tool used for automated web application security testing.

DVWA: The target application used for this security testing.

📌 Summary
Vulnerabilities Tested: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Authentication Flaws.

Skills Gained: Web Application Penetration Testing, Vulnerability Analysis, Ethical Hacking.

Documentation: All findings have been documented with visuals and supported by mitigation recommendations to improve web application security.
